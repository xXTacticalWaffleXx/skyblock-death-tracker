this program is meant to track a given players deaths in skyblock (by default my friend ohoopa)

setup

first you need to set up your build enviroment:

windows:

get a copy of vcpkg somewhere on your computer from vcpkg.io and set it up according to there instructions (remember it turns on telemetry by default so you need to use the -disablemetrics switch to disable that)

install visual studio of some sort (not vscode)

open the sln file in the root of the repo

change the configuration varibles (located at the top of hoopa deathh bot.cpp)

change from debug mode to release

press the compile button

find your exe

host it
